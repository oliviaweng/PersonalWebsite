<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>Hello! I am a first-year at <em>The University of Chicago</em>, 
	pursuing a computer science degree. Currently, I am part of a team that 
	is building a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/uchicagotechteam/illinois-jobslink">scraper</a> 
	to build an API for the Illinois Department of Human Services. I love 
	solving all kinds of problems, big or small, and I am all about learning 
	new concepts and ideas.
