      <description>Dear reader, Taking walks after lunch, mostly alone but occasionally with friends, has been one of the best decisions I&#39;ve made in college. I used to approach college with a keep-your-foot-on-the-gas-for-the-love-of-all-that-is-good mentality. Not working was bad and a waste of time. Then the unsustainability of it all hit me around my third year. It was only halfway through the year, and I woke up every day feeling burned out, worn out.</description>

      <description>Ongoing Isolating hardware bugs in implementations of cache side-channel mitigation techniques A great deal of cache side-channel mitigation techniques and designs have been implemented, but comparatively little work has gone into verifying that the sercurity properties of these designs hold true in their implementations. My research thus focuses on creating a set of experiments when given an implementation of a protected cache design with an identified security bug will isolate which part of the design is causing that bug.</description>
